# react-shopper
Full-Stack ecommerce football store leveraging React, Node, and Stripe.

After cloning, run the command: “npm install”.
Then, create another terminal (in VSCODE) and cd into the \client folder and run: “npm install” again.
Next, go to the first terminal \react-shopper, and type in "npm run dev".
This will bring up the shop. You can add/delete items to cart and checkout with Stripe.
Testing with Stripe is simple; when in checkout, enter "test" for all string inputs (name, email, address), and enter "42" repeatedly for all numerical entries (credit card no., zip-code).
